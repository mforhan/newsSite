<h2>Photo submission guidelines</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
Prairie Media Inc., accepts photo submissions from the public for reproduction in the newspaper. In order to assure quality reproduction, we have put this page together to help guide submitters on what types of imagery to send.
</p><p>
First and foremost, any images sent to Prairie Media need to be better than 'web resolution'. This means photos that display on your computer monitor at 640x480 or smaller. 
</p><p>
Second, photos that are largely scenery shots are not recommended unless specifically required for the story. Photos that include people should have the frame filled with the persons head or expression. 
<p></p>
Third, please do not submit photos printed at home. If you printed the photo,
email us the photo - scanning a print of a digital photo degrades the quality.
</p><p>
Fourth, please do not email us preview photos. These photos are frequently on
Photo CDs and are much smaller in size than the photo they represent. When in
doubt, email us the photo of the largest file size. 
</p><p>
Lastly, please ensure that all photo submissions are in color if available.
Color photos can always be reduced to black and white, but black and white
photos cannot be colorized.
